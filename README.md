# Typing Speed Test App

This project is a simple **Typing Speed Test** web application where users can measure their typing speed in terms of words per minute (WPM). It dynamically generates a random quote for typing and tracks the user's performance.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works well across devices with different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Quotes**: Loads a new quote for every test session.
- **Typing Stats**: Displays elapsed time and calculated WPM in real-time.
- **Restart Option**: Allows users to reset the test for a new session.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for functionality, including calculating stats and handling user input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

### Installation
1. Download the project files:
   - `TypingSpeed.html`
   - `TypingSpeed.js`
2. Ensure both files are in the same directory.

### Running the Application
1. Open the `TypingSpeed.html` file in your web browser.
2. Start typing in the provided text area to test your speed.
3. Use the **Restart** button to reset the session.

## File Descriptions

### TypingSpeed.html
- The main HTML structure and layout of the application.
- Includes a styled container with a heading, quote section, input area, stats display, and a restart button.
- Links to the required external JavaScript file.

### TypingSpeed.js
- Contains all the JavaScript logic to:
  - Fetch random quotes.
  - Calculate typing speed in words per minute.
  - Track and display time and performance metrics.
  - Handle user interaction and events.

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, a random quote is fetched and displayed.
2. The user types the quote into the text area.
3. As the user types, the application calculates and updates:
   - Time elapsed.
   - Words typed per minute.
4. Upon clicking **Restart**, the test resets with a new quote.

## Customization

- Modify the styles in the `<style>` section of `TypingSpeed.html` to adjust the visual design.
- Update the logic in `TypingSpeed.js` to introduce new features or enhance functionality.

## Future Improvements

- Add a database of quotes or integrate with an API for diverse content.
- Implement error tracking to provide accuracy metrics.
- Include user authentication and save typing history.
